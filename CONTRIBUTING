# 🤝 Contributing to the Oracle PL/SQL Language Pack

Thank you for helping improve this VS Code language extension. The notes below keep changes consistent and easy to review.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   VS Code with the `Extension Development Host` profile available

Install dependencies once:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## ✍️ Making changes

-   **Grammar**: `syntaxes/plsql.tmLanguage` (TextMate grammar) and `syntaxes/plsql.configuration.json` (brackets, comments, word patterns).
-   **Snippets & completions**: `snippets/plsql.snippets.json`, `snippets/plsql.completion.json`, `snippets/pldoc.json`.
-   **Extension metadata**: `package.json` (display name, categories, activation, contributed languages).

Tips:

-   Keep scope names stable to avoid breaking user themes.
-   If you add new file extensions, register them in `contributes.languages[0].extensions` and ensure sample files exist for testing.
-   Prefer small, focused pull requests with a short rationale for each change.

## 🚀 Opening pull requests

-   Describe the change and its motivation in the PR body.
-   Include screenshots when altering highlighting or snippets.
-   Mention any known regressions or follow-up work.

Thanks for contributing!
